# IoT-Based RFID Access Control System using ESP8266  This project is a smart access control system that uses an RFID reader (MFRC522) and an ESP8266 Wi-Fi microcontroller to manage entry and exit through a servo-controlled gate. It authenticates users based on RFID card UIDs and logs real-time access data to Google Sheets using HTTP requests.
